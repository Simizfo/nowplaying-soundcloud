# Now Playing for SoundCloud
"Now Playing" is an experimental fullscreen player experience for SoundCloud.

In its current form, it's a Tampermonkey script, I might make it as a standalone extension later.
This is really a proof of concept, and it's resource-intensive. It needs a lot of optimization work.

## Installation
- Download the js userscript from the releases page, and add it to Tampermonkey.
- You'll see a new button in soundcloud, next to the "Up next" button, press it to open the full screen experience.

## What is in this repo
- Two screenshot files (screen0.jpg, screen1.jpg)
- The tampermonkey script (nowplaying.js) <- This is the only one you need
- The source for the html and the linked css file (nowplaying.html, nowplaying.css)

## Issues and Suggestions
Please open a ticket if you want to report an issue or ask for a new feature. This is a side project that I'm releasing for the sake of not forgetting it, so don't expect me to fix bugs :P
